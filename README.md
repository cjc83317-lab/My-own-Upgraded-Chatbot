 Teachable Chatbot with Fallback Logic
This is a Python-based chatbot designed for real-world use and teaching. It combines intent classification, math solving, and location-aware responses with robust fallback logic using DuckDuckGo and Wikipedia. It also includes fuzzy matching to handle typos and vague queries.



⚠️ Note: This project does not include a pre-trained model.
To use the chatbot, run `train_chatbot.py` to generate `chatbot_model.pkl` from `intents.json`.
